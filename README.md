# PursuitUSVRaffleApp

An application that allows a user to view a collection of raffles. They can also create a new raffle, register for an existing raffle, as well as pick a raffle's winner. This app was built with UIKit, uses compositional layout, includes native animations, and follows the MVC design pattern.

# Future Implementations
